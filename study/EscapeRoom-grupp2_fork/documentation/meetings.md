We set a plan for the whole project and decided that Elena & Kirill are responsible for moment 1, Dennis & Magnus for moment 2 and Ronja & Linnea for moment 3. We agreed on using Elenas repo and to use Git lens to handle conflicts easier. 

We set a number one rule: To ALWAYS pull before we push to avoid conflicts! We decided to communicate through PR, Projectboard in GitHub, Issues and our chattgroup in discord.

Today we have discussed how to move forward with our project. We have debugged code together so that our groupmembers can solve their problems. We had discussions about vite and bundling and we made a decision to convert our project to vite. We decided that for each PR has to have two reviewers to ensure that the code holds a high quality before merging. 

We are in phase.
